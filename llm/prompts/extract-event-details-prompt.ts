  Convert extracted dates to ISO 8601 format.

  <example_1>
    If the Source of Truth states:
    "15 May—24 June 2025"

    You should respond with:
    start_date: "2025-05-15"

    1. If you are unable to extract a start date, set it to null.
    2. If you are unable to extract an end date, set it to null.
    3. If you are only able to extract a start date and the end date is not present in the "Source of truth", set the end date to the start date.
    4. Convert all dates to ISO 8601 format. For example, September 27, 2025 is represented as 2025-09-27.
    5. If you are unable to accurately infer the year of the event, you can assume the current year. For example if the event states 12th Jan - 15th Feb. You can assume it is referring to the current year.
    6. Never fabricate dates! If you are unable to determine the exact dates, set the date to null.
    7. All dates in these instructions are for demonstration purposes. Do not use them in your response. Use the "Source of truth" to extract the correct dates for the given event.

    Identify a Private Viewing: Check if the source text indicates a private viewing.

    A private viewing can be labeled with terms such as:

    "Private View" "PV" "Opening Night", "Opening Reception", "Opening Party", "First View", "First Viewing", "Launch Night", "Launch Party", "Launch Event", "Drinks Reception", "Reception", "Preview" or any similar phrase.

    Extract Dates: If a private viewing exists, extract two pieces of information:

    1. private_view_start_date (in ISO 8601 format with time)
    2. private_view_end_date (in ISO 8601 format with time)

    Do not use the general event start_date or end_date as the private viewing times. Only rely on what is explicitly stated for the private view.

    It is parammount that you extract the exact time for the private view. Double check that the time is accurate and that it is in the correct format.

    <example_1>
      If the Source of Truth says:

      "Opening reception:
      10 April 18:00 - 20:00"

      You should respond with:
      private_view_start_date: "2025-04-10T18:00:00.000Z"
      private_view_end_date:   "2025-04-10T20:00:00.000Z"
    </example_1>

    <example_2>
      If the Source of Truth says:

      "Opening reception: 6:30–8:30pm"

      You should respond with:
      private_view_start_date: "2025-04-10T18:30:00.000Z"
      private_view_end_date:   "2025-04-10T20:30:00.000Z"
    </example_2>

    <important>
      1. If a private view is identified, return the private_view_start_date and private_view_end_date in ISO 8601 format with time.
      2. If you find no private view, do not fabricate any dates. Return null.
      3. Use ISO 8601 for all returned dates and times.
      4. Always use the exact time of the event as stated in the "Source of Truth". For example if the event starts at 6:15pm, record 2025-04-10T18:15:00.000Z and not 2025-04-10T18:00:00.000Z
      4. No Fabrication: Only use date/time details found in the "Source of Truth".
      5. Ignore Example Values: Any dates/times shown in these instructions are for demonstration only. Do not reference them directly in your answer.
