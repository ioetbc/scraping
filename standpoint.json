    "info": "Huang was joined by Seán Elder, a curator and writer from the Scottish Highlands and currently the Curatorial Fellow at Cubitt, London, where their programme 'Feeling Still in a World Which Runs' is unfolding. Huang is the 21st winner of the MTSA, the most significant award for emerging UK artists working in the field of sculpture. In this exhibition, Huang continued her investigation into mass production and commerce, the transcultural and historical dimensions of the food industry, and the implications of such markets on our natural environment. Using a variety of manual techniques, Huang transformed everyday spaces and objects, resulting in minimalist sculptures and poetically charged installations of quiet resonance.",
