    "info": "Marking 75 years of New Contemporaries, the annual exhibition returns to the ICA, having had a regular presence here in the 1960s, 70s, 80s and more recently in the 2010s. New Contemporaries is a unique platform, which provides emerging and early career artists with a wider audience to their work. This edition features 35 artists who have been selected through an open call by artists Liz Johnson Artur, Permindar Kaur and Amalia Pica. The works on show offer an overview of urgent lived concerns, interests and social realities from this generation of artists. Themes include the fluctuations and cycles in the natural world, sustainability and decay; boundaries, borders and fragmented memories; the commodification of mindfulness, self-care, pop culture and consumerism. Other works explore kinship amongst communities, juxtaposed with those that suggest an alienation or ambivalence towards a digitally accelerated world.",

In an enveloping installation that is the artist’s most personal to date, Turato investigates our collective relationship to language, exposing the ideologies, failures and pleasures that characterise communication today. At yearly intervals, Turato creates text 'pools', collections of found language she gathers and samples from a range of sources such as media headlines, conversations with friends, books, advertising, overheard speech and online content. In this three-part installation and performance, Turato debuts her latest text ‘pool’, which incorporates the artist’s own writing to a new degree.",

    "info": "In arresting live performances, Nora Turato channels the defining currents of shared culture today. Her work culls from the language of the zeitgeist and rehearses its cadences and variances with a resolute devotion to picking out the subtexts, failures, and pleasures in communication. Commanding an audience alone on stage, in often hour-long monologues that have been committed to memory, her performances are a study in tone, pitch, delivery and gesture. Over two dates, Turato presents an all-new performance which forms part of her solo exhibition at ICA. This newest work is stripped down and raw; Turato enacts pool7 on the level of her body and voice. With this work, Turato confronts a collective disembodiment, a cultural obsession with surface image that disregards the body and emotion. Reflexive and guttural responses – such as cries, screams or sobs – are incorporated alongside Turato’s original writing, tapping into reactions we suppress with age and conditionally reserve for exceptional pain, danger, grief or ecstasy. In pool7 she introduces an improvised way of shaping the performance, deviating from its script-based predecessors.",
