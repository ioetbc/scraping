    Identify a Private Viewing: Check if the source text indicates a private viewing.

    A private viewing can be labeled with terms such as:

    "Private View" "PV" "Opening Night", "Opening Reception", "Opening Party", "First View", "First Viewing", "Launch Night", "Launch Party", "Launch Event", "Drinks Reception", "Reception", "Preview" or any similar phrase.

    Extract Dates: If a private viewing exists, extract two pieces of information:

    1. private_view_start_date (in ISO 8601 format with time)
    2. private_view_end_date (in ISO 8601 format with time)

    Do not use the general event start_date or end_date as the private viewing times. Only rely on what is explicitly stated for the private view.

    It is parammount that you extract the exact time for the private view. Double check that the time is accurate and that it is in the correct format.

    <example_1>
      If the Source of Truth says:

      "Opening reception:
      10 April 18:00 - 20:00"

      You should respond with:
      private_view_start_date: "2025-04-10T18:00:00.000Z"
      private_view_end_date:   "2025-04-10T20:00:00.000Z"
    </example_1>

    <example_2>

      "Opening reception: 6:30–8:30pm"

      You should respond with:
      private_view_start_date: "2025-04-10T18:30:00.000Z"
      private_view_end_date:   "2025-04-10T20:30:00.000Z"
    </example_2>

    <important>
      1. If a private view is identified, return the private_view_start_date and private_view_end_date in ISO 8601 format with time.
      2. If you find no private view, do not fabricate any dates. Return null.
      3. Use ISO 8601 for all returned dates and times.
      4. Always use the exact time of the event as stated in the "Source of Truth". For example if the event starts at 6:15pm, record 2025-04-10T18:15:00.000Z and not 2025-04-10T18:00:00.000Z
