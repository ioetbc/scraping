Wenhai Ning (b. 1999, China)
Ning Wenhai currently lives and works in London. He graduated with an MA in Painting from the Royal College of Art in 2023. Ning sees the tiny, yet rich biomes within the soil as a bridge between humanity and the natural world. He reflects deeply on the symbiotic bond between these realms, exploring the connections they share. Through his unique fusion of soil & oil painting, Ning contemplates the origins and evolution of life, imbuing the earth with a renewed vitality and fostering growth in ecologically fragile landscapes.
Liu Yangwen (b. 1995, China)
Liu Yangwen currently works and lives in Nanjing, China. He is a graduate of the Oil Painting Department of the Fine Arts School at Nanjing University of the Arts. Liu debuted his first solo exhibition titled ‘Dazzling Flowers, Spinning Gazes’ at Tong Gallery+Projects in Beijing in 2021. His work has also been exhibited in group exhibitions at Masterpiece London Art Fair, 3812 Gallery, Shanghai Duolun Museum of Modern Art, and Jiangsu Provincial Art Museum.
Liu Yangwen’s practice, marked by a transition from figurative floral art to abstract expressionism, challenges conventional perspectives on flowers, utilising cool tones and powerful linework to convey solemnity and complexity. He begins by bringing to life the bouquet in his mind before changing its essence through the reconstruction of lines. The flowers gradually begin to disappear giving way to an intricate pathwork that breaks through the traditional boundaries of painting embracing Liu’s own artistic language and spirit.
Jack Whitelock (b.1997, England)
Jack Whitelock is a painter from Hull, Yorkshire. He obtained a BA in Painting at the Edinburgh College of Art (2020) before completing his Masters degree in Painting at the Royal College of Art (2023), where he was a recipient of the Ali H. Alkazzi Scholarship award.
“Style is not a concern, but a symptom of whatever face I’m wearing in the moment of applying paint to a surface. Through an embracement of stylistic freedom, a painting that could be rooted in doubts, fears, curiosities, can oscillate to something embedded in notions of loss and growth, disruption and repair, hope and resilience. It is within this oscillation that painting provides spaces for change. Ranging from the subject matter of trees, landscapes, flowers or abstraction, I use painterly interventions to realise and dissect lived experiences into material, becoming a vessel to hold psychologies or to satisfy curiosities. Each work is an act of rewiring and rediscovering new patterns, mysteries, processes and memories.” – Jack Whitelock
