I’ve always been fascinated with what I call ‘the invisible presence’. The most
permanent thing in this world is the invisible; you never get away from it.
– Betty Parsons, Interview reproduced in Judith Stein and Helène Aylon,
‘The Parsons Effect’, Art in America, 11 November 2013

Alison Jacques is pleased to announce our second solo exhibition of American artist Betty Parsons (1900 – 1982). This exhibition showcases over thirty years of Parsons’ practice, covering the period from 1950 until 1981. The show includes paintings on canvas and paper, as well as sculpture.
‘I knew about painting because I was a painter’, Parsons once remarked of her
career as one of New York’s leading gallerists.1 Parsons’ prowess as founder and
director of Betty Parsons Gallery (1946-1983) has long obscured an appreciation
of her own artistic endeavours. While her discerning eye helped launch the
careers of many notable artists, including Agnes Martin and Jackson Pollock,
Parsons maintained a rigorous commitment to her own practice. ‘When I’m not at
the gallery, my own art is my relaxation’, she once said. ‘That’s my greatest joy’.2 ‘I would give up my gallery in a second if the world would accept me as an artist’.3
Parsons’ practice was concerned largely with the exploration of colour. Her
paintings can be characterised through their large, sinuous swathes of colour
that playfully interact, punctuating her saturated canvases. Much like other
works included in this exhibition, the forms that feature in Summer Fire (1959)
do not possess hard, defined edges, but rather stand apart from one another
through drastic changes in tonality: an almost fluorescent orange glows in the
centre of the canvas, the vibrancy of this inclusion amplified by the subtler
greens, greys and blues that surround it. Parsons’ use of the grattage technique,
etching into her painterly surface, reveals more streaks of orange even in places
the colour has been painted over. For Parsons, the bold colours that feature in works such as Snake Plant (1975) and Fun (1974) had the ability to
infuse forms with a sort of kinetic energy. Her move towards abstraction was in
part influenced by her experience of attending a rodeo in the mid-1940s: ‘I saw all
the movement, the noise, the colour, the excitement, the passion. I thought, my
God, how can you ever capture this except in an abstract sense?’4
Parsons’ paintings reflect a desire to convey a sheer energy; she was particularly
interested in the principles of the auratic, and what she termed the new spirit.
Her instinct for colour was something cultivated during years of travel; her trips
to Japan, Africa and Mexico greatly inspired her painterly practice. Parsons’
titles often hint at the subjects included in her works, which the artist’s abstract
configurations alone do not communicate. Found Forms (1978), for instance,
flatly renders an assortment of shapes using thick bands of individual colour that
become hand-sized objects upon discovery of the title. The bullseyes that make
up Circles (1967) are also surrounded by abstracted curves painted in the same
tone, part and whole seen within a single frame.
Incorporated alongside paintings on canvas, this exhibition also includes a
selection of Parsons’ paintings and drawings on paper and newsprint. These
works bring a diaristic perspective to Parsons’ corpus: Parsons was known to
urgently open her sketchbook in order to document the energy she experienced
in specific locations and times, abstractly capturing a moment as one might
ordinarily do with a photograph. A playful immediacy is palpable in these works.
Drawings such as Seed Pods (1968) and Cocoon (1968) exemplify Parsons’ experimental groupings
of colour and shape; such is emphasised by the visibility of the white paper
underneath and between her pen marks. A similar technique is implemented in
her acrylic on paper works, where Parsons’ visible brushstrokes communicate a
sense of movement and speed, leaving behind pockets of bright white that create
a visual dynamism to the compositions. The intimate scale of these works offers a
more personal insight into Parsons’ practice.
Parsons returned to sculpture in 1965, which had been one of the artist’s first
mediums. She experimented with elements of found material such as driftwood,
signage, and disassembled furniture that she collected from the beach near her home. Once assembled into shapes reminiscent of buildings, toys or masks,
Parsons treated these assemblages with paint in the same way she would a canvas,
covering the items in blocks of pigment or using gestural lines, as can be seen in works like Beach Police (1968) and Flight (1981). Such a process
gave new life to these forgotten objects that now seem to carry the weight of
mementos; these sculptures are indelibly connected to Parsons’ deep interest in
the mysticism contained within Native American craft and artistic production.
The small scale of Parsons’ sculptures has abetted a comparison to ‘domestic
objects’ or ‘knick-knacks’, a disparaging dismissal of Parsons’ significance as a
female artist.5 By showcasing Parsons’ entire oeuvre, this exhibition spotlights
Parsons’ multimodal practice, and calls for a redress of Parsons’ significance
in both narratives of the time period and in the contemporary. The latter
is reinforced by Parsons’ inclusion within recent exhibitions at Whitechapel
Gallery, London (2023), and museum acquisitions including the Whitney Museum
of American Art, New York and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, among others internationally.
