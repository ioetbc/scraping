Søren Arildsen, ‘Bountiful’, 2025. Oil on linen, distemper, pigments, porcelain frame, 44 x 34 cm.
The Artist Room presents In the Seams, a solo exhibition by Søren Arildsen (b. 1996) and his first in the UK. The show features a new series of oil paintings on canvas set in artist-made porcelain frames, as well as ceramic paintings mounted in treated wood.
Arildsen’s work explores how memories take shape, blending reality with recollection and daydreams. While rooted in figuration, his use of materials and process creates a shifting quality, as if the images are drifting in and out of focus, leading the viewer to somewhere between the real and the imagined.
