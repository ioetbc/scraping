Coinciding with its 9th anniversary, ANNKA KULTYS GALLERY is delighted to announce the launch of its new digital programme Illuminated: Moving Image Perspectives, which will take place over the course of a year (from 17 November 2024 — 16 November 2025), and elaborates on the gallery’s expertise in moving image and reaffirms its ongoing commitment to this field.
On a weekly basis, Illuminated: Moving Image Perspectives: will offer unique insights into a new media artist using film, video animation, as well as their latest technological explorations, including blockchain and advanced technologies such as AI. The program has so far featured Jonas Lund, Sara Sadik, Oliver Laric, Lauren Lee McCarthy, Nicolas Sassoon, and Aram Bartholl with upcoming contributions from Tamiko Thiel and Che-Yu Hsu. This project aims to showcase and contextualise diverse digital art practices, while introducing international artists and their distinctive approaches to the gallery’s audience.
The online streams will be augmented by physical presentations of digital artworks in a private home setting at ANNKA KULTYS LOFT, the gallery founder’s loft in Shoreditch. These installations will be accompanied by regular, invitation-only dinners and carefully curated exclusive viewings for art professionals, fostering deeper connections between artists, collectors, journalists, and museum curators.
Subsequently the artworks will be featured in a group exhibition at ANNKA KULTYS PHYGITAL. This VR group show will open end of May 2025 to coincide with London Gallery Weekend, highlighting contributions from 26 artists as part of this year-long initiative, then the second part of the VR with the other 26 artists in November 2025.
As part of this initiative, prints of video stills by the artists will be made available for purchase on the gallery’s website. Furthermore, the gallery is pleased to announce a monthly giveaway, offering subscribers the opportunity to win a selected artist print. Each giveaway will be introduced in the monthly Full Moon newsletter, with the winner announced in the subsequent edition, scheduled for 13 January 2025.
