As new technologies and shifting consciousness redefine humanity, what new ceremonies emerge? How do we develop new rites for climate resilience, migration, and virtual co-presence? How do collective practices foster resistance, care, and solidarity in a rapidly shifting world? What roles do ritual and ceremony play in addressing systemic change and marginalisation?We are looking for proposals that consider these cultural shifts, engaging with speculative, experimental, and socially engaged approaches. We welcome multidisciplinary proposals spanning but not limited to visual art, performance, sound, digital media, and community-based work.Submissions can include fully formed proposals or late-stage ideas with room to develop through curatorial support.What Selected Projects ReceiveArtist Fee (in-kind) – Including exhibition space and mentoring.Curatorial & Production Support from Shane Sutherland (Curatorial Assistant) and the 198 CAL Gallery team.6-week Exhibition Space & Resources (May - June 2025).Public Programming Opportunities (workshops, talks, performances).Mentorship & Network Building with arts professionals.EligibilityCurators & Artists with 3+ years of professional practice.Emerging creative practitioners (students are not eligible).Existing funding and partnerships are a plus but not required.Proposal suitable for an 6-week exhibition (May–June 2025).Key Dates26th March 2025 – Open call launches10th April 2025 – Q&A drop-in session (online)15th April 2025 – Submission deadlineMay 2025 – Provisional exhibition datesSelection ProcessProposals will be reviewed by a panel including:Nimco Kulmiye Hussein (Artistic Director, 198CAL)Shane Sutherland (Curatorial Assistant, 198CAL)Invited Guest PanelistSelections will be based on conceptual strength, originality, feasibility, and alignment with the open call themes and artistic programme.How to ApplySubmit your proposal HERE by Sunday, 23:59, 15th April 2025.Access & Support198CAL is committed to accessibility.
