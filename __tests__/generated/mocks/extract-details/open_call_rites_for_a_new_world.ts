================================

Wednesday, 26 Mar 2025—Wednesday, 16 Apr 2025

![](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.prismic.io%2F198cal%2FZ-LXaXdAxsiBv40T_Post_Human_Rites_Rituals_for_a_New_World__1614050628copy.png%3Fauto%3Dformat%252Ccompress%26rect%3D2%252C13%252C493%252C257%26w%3D1512%26h%3D788&w=3840&q=75)

### **About** 

198 CAL invites curators and artists to take part in our next open call with an exhibition proposal. 

In an age marked by climate precarity, digital intimacy, and biotechnological evolution, how do we adapt? As new technologies and shifting consciousness redefine humanity, what new ceremonies emerge? 

How do we develop new rites for climate resilience, migration, and virtual co-presence? How do collective practices foster resistance, care, and solidarity in a rapidly shifting world? What roles do ritual and ceremony play in addressing systemic change and marginalisation?

We are looking for proposals that consider these cultural shifts, engaging with speculative, experimental, and socially engaged approaches. We welcome multidisciplinary proposals spanning but not limited to visual art, performance, sound, digital media, and community-based work.

Submissions can include fully formed proposals or late-stage ideas with room to develop through curatorial support.
